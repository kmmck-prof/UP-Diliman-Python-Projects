# Final Exam: Resistor Network Calculator
I developed this project as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course to analyze and simplify resistor networks represented as graphs. The program parses resistor connections, identifies series and parallel configurations, and computes equivalent resistances between nodes (such as Vdd and GND) using iterative simplifications and Delta-Wye (Δ-Y) transformations when necessary.

Key Features:

Milestone 1: Determines if two resistors are in series, parallel, or neither.

Milestone 2: Groups resistors into series/parallel clusters and calculates their equivalent resistances.

Milestone 3: Simplifies the entire network using only series and parallel reductions.

Milestone 4: Handles complex networks requiring Delta-Wye transformations for accurate resistance calculations.

Implementation Details:
Built in Python using dictionaries for efficient resistor and node storage.

Applied sorting algorithms to organize resistor groups lexicographically.

Implemented graph traversal techniques to analyze connections and compute resistances.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of graph theory, algorithmic problem-solving, and efficient data structure usage in real-world applications.
