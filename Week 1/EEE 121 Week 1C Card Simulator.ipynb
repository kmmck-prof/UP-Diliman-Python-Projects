The attribute `value` takes in the digits 1 to 10 as well as the standard face cards, Jack, Queen, and King. The `suite` attribute takes in the four suites, namely `clubs`, `spades`, `hearts`, and `diamonds`. Obviously, two cards are equal if they have the same value and suite.\n","\n","The `CardSet` class is just an ensemble of `Card` instances. To know which cards are in your set, just iterate through the cards via the `view` method. This gets a formatted list of your cards in the `cards` attribute. To add cards to your set, use the `add_cards` method.\n","\n","The `Deck` class is a child class of the `CardSet` class. To initialize a deck, all 52 cards from the standard deck must be added to it. For uniformity, place each suite in ascending value -- 1 to 10, then Jack, then Queen, then King. The suites must be placed in this order: `clubs` - `spades` - `hearts` - `diamonds`. Note that all the `diamond`-suited cards are at the top of the deck, while the `clubs` are at the bottom of the deck. To visualize:\n","\n","```\n","cards_in_deck = [\"1 of clubs\", \"2 of clubs\", ... \"King of clubs\", \"1 of spades\",\n","            \"2 of spades\", ... \"King of spades\", \"1 of hearts\", \n","            \"2 of hearts\", ... \"King of hearts\", \"1 of diamonds\", \n","            \"2 of diamonds\", ... \"King of diamonds\"]\n","```\n","\n","\n","The cards inside a deck may also be shuffled. A `seed` argument is added for reproducibility. The `peek` method of the class allow you to peek at the top $n$ cards. The default value for $n$ is 5.\n","\n","Lastly, The `draw` method allows you to draw the top $n$ cards of the deck and transfer these cards to a `CardSet` instance. The default value of $n$ is 5. Note that the number of cards that you can draw cannot exceed the current number of cards in the deck.\n","\n","In this exercise, you will simulate drawing two sets, each with $n$ cards from a shuffled deck.\n","\n","### Input Format\n","The first line contains a comma-seperated string containing the integer $seed$, which is the seed for reproducibility, $hand$, the number of cards to draw per card set, and $peek$, the number of cards to peek at the top of the deck.
